Specifically, (a) should be linked to Article 25(a), (b) to Article 25(b), (c) to Article 25(c), and (d) to Article 25(d). Despite the incorrect referencing, the core content is accurate, hence 'PARTLY_RELEVANT'."
119,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses principles related to the process of law enforcement and justice but cites Article 159 instead of the relevant Article 25 mentioned in the original answer. While Article 159 indeed pertains to judicial authority and principles of justice, the question specifically asks for guarantees regarding the process of law enforcement and justice, and the original answer directly addresses this with specific rights and freedoms in Article 25."
120,NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer refers to Article 29(1)(b) of the Kenya 2010 Constitution, which is not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer focuses on Article 25 of a different constitution, specifically addressing the rights that cannot be limited, including the right to an order of habeas corpus, which implicitly ensures individuals are not held in detention indefinitely without cause. Therefore, the generated answer is not relevant to the original context."

However, it deviates from the original answer by introducing Article 51(1) and Article 26(3), which are not directly relevant to the circumstances under which a person can be deprived of freedom as outlined in Article 29. Therefore, while some points are relevant, others are not, leading to a 'PARTLY_RELEVANT' classification."
138,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly mentions the scenario 'During a State of Emergency' from the original answer's clause (b). However, it also introduces an additional scenario about 'For a Child as a Measure of Last Resort' which is not covered in the original answer. This makes the answer partly relevant as it accurately includes one condition but also adds unrelated information."
139,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a broader perspective on the protections against violence, including those from private sources, which is relevant to the question. However, it does not directly address the specific protections outlined in the original answer, particularly Article 29(c), which specifically mentions protection against violence from both public and private sources.

144,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the two main prohibitions regarding a person's labor as stated in the original answer: (1) prohibition of slavery or servitude, and (2) prohibition of forced labour.

145,NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses rights related to fair labor practices, remuneration, working conditions, trade unions, strikes, and collective bargaining, as outlined in Article 41. However, the original answer from Chapter 4: THE BILL OF RIGHTS, specifically Article 30, states that a person shall not be held in slavery or servitude and shall not be required to perform forced labor. The generated answer does not address the core themes of the original answer, which are focused on prohibiting slavery and forced labor."
146,PARTLY_RELEVANT,The generated answer acknowledges the prohibition on requiring someone to perform forced labor as stated in Article 30(2) but does not provide a specific punishment as the original answer does not include one.

However, it goes beyond the original answer by introducing additional rights from Article 22(1) and mentioning the Kenya National Human Rights and Equality Commission, which are not part of the original answer.

Therefore, while the answer partially addresses the question, it also includes extraneous information."
252,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides additional details about specific groups mentioned in various articles, which are relevant to the question. However, it does not directly quote or paraphrase the information from the original answer, which states that the Part applies to 'certain groups of persons.'

341,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the importance of legislation and rights related to the environment, but it does not directly address the specific measures for assessing and monitoring the environment as outlined in the original answer.

346,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly identifies the court's ability to provide compensation for victims (point 1) and to issue an injunction (point 2), which are directly mentioned in the original answer. However, it also includes additional points (points 3, 4, and 5) that are not directly supported by the original text. While these points may be related to broader legal principles, they are not explicitly stated in Article 70. Therefore, the generated answer is partly relevant but also includes some extraneous information."
