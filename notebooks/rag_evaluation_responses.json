This includes practices that maintain or enhance the land's fertility, biodiversity, and ecological balance.\n\n2. **Sound Conservation and Protection of Ecologically Sensitive Areas (Article 60(1)(e))**: This principle encourages the protection of areas that are crucial for the environment, such as forests, wetlands, and wildlife habitats. This helps to maintain ecosystem services and biodiversity.\n\n3. **Regulation of Land Use (Article 66(1) and (2))**: The State is empowered to regulate land use to ensure it aligns with public interests, including land use planning. This can help prevent overuse, misuse, or degradation of land, and promote sustainable and productive use. Additionally, Parliament is required to ensure that investments in property benefit local communities and their economies, promoting a balanced and sustainable approach to land management.\n\n4. **Transparent and Cost Effective Administration of Land (Article 60(1)(d))**: Efficient and transparent land administration can help prevent disputes, reduce corruption, and ensure that land is used productively.

This suggests that any laws, policies, or practices that disadvantage women in land and property matters should be identified and amended.\n\n2. **Legislation on Land (Article 68(c)(iii))**: Parliament is required to enact legislation to regulate the recognition and protection of matrimonial property, including the matrimonial home. This can help address gender discrimination by ensuring that women's property rights are protected, especially during and after divorce or separation.\n\n3. **Equality and Freedom from Discrimination (Article 27)**: This article guarantees equality and freedom from discrimination for all, including women. It requires the State to take legislative and other measures to address past discrimination.
