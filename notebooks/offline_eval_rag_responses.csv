This means that if a Kenyan citizen is born to at least one Kenyan parent, they do not lose their Kenyan citizenship even if they acquire another country's citizenship.

2. **Article 78(2)** states that a State officer or a member of the defense forces shall not hold dual citizenship. However, this article does not apply to ordinary citizens, only to those holding specific offices or positions.

Therefore, a Kenyan citizen can retain their Kenyan citizenship after acquiring another country's citizenship, as long as they are not a State officer or a member of the defense forces.","chapter: Chapter 3: CITIZENSHIP
part: 
title: Article 16: Dual citizenship.
clauses: A citizen by birth does not lose citizenship by acquiring the citizenship of
another country."
73,Does the Kenyan constitution allow for dual citizenship?,"Based on the provided context, the Kenyan constitution does not explicitly allow or disallow dual citizenship. The relevant article, Article 18, only outlines the areas that Parliament should legislate on regarding citizenship, including procedures for becoming a citizen, entry into and residence in Kenya, and renunciation of citizenship. There is no mention of dual citizenship in this article or any other article provided in the context. Therefore, the constitution does not directly address the issue of dual citizenship.","chapter: Chapter 3: CITIZENSHIP

another country."
74,How does the constitution handle citizenship when a Kenyan also holds another country's passport?,"Based on the provided context from the Kenya 2010 Constitution, here's how it handles citizenship when a Kenyan also holds another country's passport:

1. **Dual Citizenship**: A Kenyan citizen by birth does not lose their Kenyan citizenship even if they acquire the citizenship of another country (Article 16).

2. **Rights of Citizenship**: Every Kenyan citizen is entitled to a Kenyan passport (Article 12(1)(b)). However, a passport may be denied, suspended, or confiscated only in accordance with an Act of Parliament (Article 12(2)).

3. **Leadership and Integrity**: A State officer or a member of the defence forces shall not hold dual citizenship (Article 78(2)). However, this does not apply to judges, members of commissions, or those who have been made citizens of another country by operation of that country's law without the ability to opt out (Article 78(3)).

4. **Revocation of Citizenship**: A citizen's passport may be revoked if they acquired their Kenyan citizenship by fraud, or if they commit certain serious offenses (Article 17). This includes cases where a person was presumed to be a citizen by birth, but it's later discovered they were a citizen of another country or were older than eight years when found in Kenya (Article 17(2)).","chapter: Chapter 3: CITIZENSHIP

1. **Article 48**: The State shall ensure access to justice for all persons. This means the State has an obligation to create an environment where everyone can seek and obtain justice.

This implies that the State should ensure that the cost of accessing justice does not act as a barrier for anyone.

2. **Article 50(1)**: Every person has the right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair and public hearing before a court or another independent and impartial tribunal or body. This means the State must establish and maintain independent, impartial, and fair courts and other tribunals to ensure that justice is served.

2. **Right to Fair Administrative Action (Article 47)**: This article guarantees the right to fair administrative action, which includes the right to have one's case considered by an impartial body.

While these articles do not directly address the affordability of justice, they indicate the Constitution's commitment to ensuring that justice is accessible, fair, and impartial. The affordability aspect might be more related to practical considerations such as legal aid provisions, court fees, and other related costs, which may be addressed in other legislation or policies.","chapter: Chapter 4: THE BILL OF RIGHTS

295,What aspects of land management does this article emphasize for sustainability and productivity?,"Based on the provided context, the aspects of land management that Articles 60, 68, and 66 emphasize for sustainability and productivity are:

1. **Sustainable and Productive Management of Land Resources (Article 60(1)(c))**: This article emphasizes the need for land to be managed in a way that ensures its long-term productivity and sustainability. This includes practices that maintain or enhance the land's fertility, biodiversity, and ecological balance.

2. **Sound Conservation and Protection of Ecologically Sensitive Areas (Article 60(1)(e))**: This principle encourages the protection of areas that are crucial for the environment, such as forests, wetlands, and wildlife habitats. This helps to maintain ecosystem services and biodiversity.

3. **Regulation of Land Use (Article 66(1) and (2))**: The State is empowered to regulate land use to ensure it aligns with public interests, including land use planning. This can help prevent overuse, misuse, or degradation of land, and promote sustainable and productive use.

296,How does this article suggest addressing gender discrimination in land and property law and practices?,"Based on the provided articles from the Kenya 2010 Constitution, addressing gender discrimination in land and property law and practices can be approached through the following means:

1. **Elimination of Gender Discrimination in Law, Customs, and Practices (Article 60(1)(f))**: This article explicitly requires that land and property laws, customs, and practices should eliminate gender discrimination. This suggests that any laws, policies, or practices that disadvantage women in land and property matters should be identified and amended.

2. **Legislation on Land (Article 68(c)(iii))**: Parliament is required to enact legislation to regulate the recognition and protection of matrimonial property, including the matrimonial home. This can help address gender discrimination by ensuring that women's property rights are protected, especially during and after divorce or separation.

3. **Equality and Freedom from Discrimination (Article 27)**: This article guarantees equality and freedom from discrimination for all, including women. It requires the State to take legislative and other measures to address past discrimination. In the context of land and property, this could involve affirmative action programs to ensure women have equal access to land and property rights.

4. **Gender Balance and Diversity in County Assemblies (Article 197)**: While not directly related to land and property laws, this article reflects the Constitution's commitment to gender equality. It requires that not more than two-thirds of the members of county assemblies should be of the same gender. This can help ensure that land and property policies at the county level are inclusive and consider the needs of both men and women.","chapter: Chapter 5: LAND AND ENVIRONMENT

3. **Affirmative Action**: The State is required to take legislative and other measures, including affirmative action programmes and policies, designed to redress any disadvantage suffered by individuals or groups because of past discrimination (Article 27(6)). This could include affirmative action in the appointment of judicial officers to ensure gender equality.

4. **Monitoring and Investigation**: The Kenya National Human Rights and Equality Commission (NHREC) has the function to monitor, investigate, and report on the observance of human rights in all spheres of life, including the judiciary (Article 59(2)(d)). This includes investigating any conduct in state affairs that is alleged or suspected to be prejudicial or improper, which could include issues related to gender equality in the judiciary.","chapter: Chapter 10: JUDICIARY

(a) the national legislation provides for a matter that cannot be regulated
effectively by legislation enacted by the individual counties;
(b) the national legislation provides for a matter that, to be dealt with

951,What is the effect of a court decision that one level of government's provision prevails over another's?,"Based on the provided context, specifically Article 191, when a court decision determines that one level of government's provision prevails over another's, the following effects occur:

1. **Prevalence of the Provision**: The provision of the prevailing legislation (national or county) takes precedence over the other. The other provision is not invalidated but becomes inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency (Article 191(6)).

2. **No Invalidation of Other Provision**: The other provision is not invalidated by the court's decision. It remains part of the legislation but is inoperative where it conflicts with the prevailing provision.

3. **Court's Role**: The court, in making this determination, must prefer a reasonable interpretation of the legislation that avoids conflict (Article 191(5)).

4. **No Impact on Constitutional Responsibility**: Even if a function or power is transferred between levels of government, the constitutional responsibility for it remains with the government to which it is assigned by the Fourth Schedule (Article 187(2)(b)). This means that a court decision on the prevalence of one level's provision over another does not change this constitutional responsibility.","chapter: Chapter 11: DEVOLVED GOVERNMENT

1. **Article 219** states that a county's share of revenue raised by the national government shall be transferred to the county ""without deduction, except when the transfer has been stopped under Article 225."" This means that once the revenue is allocated to a county, it cannot be deducted except in specific circumstances outlined in Article 225.

2. **Article 225** allows for the suspension of a county's revenue share in limited circumstances, such as when a county fails to comply with certain constitutional provisions or when there's a need to protect public funds. However, this article does not provide for any other deductions.

Therefore, based on the given articles, no other deductions can be made from a county's revenue share.","chapter: Chapter 12: PUBLIC FINANCE

2. **National Legislation**: National legislation should prescribe the manner in which counties should address anticipated deficits in their budgets (Article 220(2)(a)).
3. **Public Consultation**: Before the National Assembly considers the estimates of revenue and expenditure, a committee of the Assembly shall discuss and review the estimates, seeking representations from the public. This process should also consider how anticipated deficits will be addressed (Article 221(4), (5)).
4. **Appropriation Bill**: Once the estimates of national government expenditure have been approved by the National Assembly, they should be included in an Appropriation Bill. This Bill should authorize the withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund of the money needed for the expenditure, including any funds needed to cover anticipated deficits (Article 221(6)).
5. **Supplementary Appropriation**: If the amount appropriated for any purpose under the Appropriation Act is insufficient, or a need has arisen for expenditure for a purpose for which no amount has been appropriated, the national government may spend money that has not been appropriated.

2. National legislation shall prescribe when the plans and budgets of the counties shall be tabled in the county assemblies (Article 220(2)(b)).

Therefore, the timeline for county governments to prepare and adopt their annual budgets is determined by the national legislation that prescribes the structure, content, and timing of county budgets. This legislation has not been provided in the given context.","chapter: Chapter 12: PUBLIC FINANCE

1. **Division of Revenue Bill**: This Bill divides revenue raised by the national government among the national and county levels of government. It is introduced in Parliament at least two months before the end of each financial year (Article 218).

2. **County Budgets**: Each county government prepares and adopts its own annual budget and appropriation Bill based on the Division of Revenue Bill passed by Parliament (Article 224). This means the Division of Revenue Bill directly influences the revenue that counties have to work with when preparing their budgets.

So, the Division of Revenue Bill sets the revenue ceiling for county budgets. Once the Division of Revenue Bill is passed, counties use it as a basis to prepare their budgets, ensuring that their expenditure plans do not exceed the allocated revenue.","chapter: Chapter 12: PUBLIC FINANCE

1288,How does the Constitution advance the rule of law and human rights?,"The Constitution of Kenya 2010 advances the rule of law and human rights in several ways:

2. **Advancement of the Rule of Law and Human Rights (Article 259(1)(b))**: The Constitution explicitly states that it should be interpreted to advance the rule of law and the human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Bill of Rights. This is a direct advancement of these principles.

3. **Supremacy of the Constitution (Article 2)**: The Constitution is supreme and binds all persons and all State organs. This means that all actions, whether by individuals or State organs, must comply with the Constitution, including its provisions on the rule of law and human rights.

4. **Binding Nature of the Bill of Rights (Article 20(1))**: The Bill of Rights applies to all law and binds all State organs and all persons. This ensures that human rights are protected and upheld in all spheres of Kenyan society.

5. **Interpretation of the Bill of Rights (Article 20(3) and (4))**: Courts are required to interpret the Bill of Rights in a way that favors the enforcement of human rights and promotes the values underlying an open and democratic society. This ensures that human rights are given the broadest possible interpretation.

6. **National Values and Principles of Governance (Article 10)**: The Constitution outlines national values and principles of governance that include the rule of law, democracy, human dignity, equity, social justice, human rights, non-discrimination, and protection of the marginalised. These values guide the application and interpretation of the Constitution, further advancing the rule of law and human rights.","chapter: Chapter 17: GENERAL PROVISIONS

This doctrine ensures that:

1. **Offices and Functions**: A function or power conferred on an office can be performed or exercised by the person holding the office as and when required (Article 259(3)(a)).
2. **Acting Officers**: Any reference to a State or public office, or an officer, includes the person acting in or performing the functions of that office at any particular time (Article 259(3)(b)).
3. **Name Changes**: A reference to an office, State organ, or locality named in the Constitution should be read with any necessary formal alterations to make it applicable in the circumstances (Article 259(3)(c)).
4. **Successors**: A reference to an office, body, or organization that has ceased to exist is a reference to its successor or equivalent (Article 259(3)(d)).
